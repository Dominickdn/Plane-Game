# Plane-Game
A 2D game made in vanilla JS, HTML and CSS using the canvas element.

I created this simple game to put some of the concepts I was learning in java script to the test. I got inspiration from google dinosaur game as well as flappy bird.
I liked the simplicity of these games but wanted to create something unique.
